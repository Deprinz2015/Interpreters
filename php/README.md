# PLox Lox Interpreter written in PHP

The first complete Interpreter for a language called 'Lox' is written in PHP.

It is a Recursive-Descent-Interpreter and is implemented after Part II of [CraftingInterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-tree-walk-interpreter.html)

PHP is chosen for simplicity, GC and familiarity with the language.
