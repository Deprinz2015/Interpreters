# Mono Repo for Interpreters

This project follows this book: [CraftingInterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html)

This Project will contain at least 2 implementations:

- plox
- zlox

Plox is done. Maybe i extend it in the future, idk tho. maybe not. probably not.

Zlox is currently at the point, where i decided to diverge from the implementation in the book. I skipped the classes and instances
and went through the optimizations he showed. After that i include a dynamic datastructure, similar to php's arrays. Well, i try to at least.
